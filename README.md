### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary: The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution. This project can encrypt and decrypt a Vigenere cipher of language:  English, Dutch, Italian, French, Danish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish. 

We are using four class to implement this project. 

1) CaesarCipher class: It encrypts and decrypts a String of message pulled up from a file, using a key. 

2) CaesarCracker class: It tries to crack Caesar cipher using brute force technique and using the most common character and its occurrence in that language. 

3) VigenereCipher class: It encrypts and decrypts the String of message from a file using interwoven Ceaser coding and decrypts it using the array of keys used while encryption. 

4) VigenereBreaker class: It tries to break the Vigenere cipher, by trying 100 key sets for different languages. This class can break a Vigenere cipher of language:  English, Dutch, Italian, French, Danish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish. 

* Version 1.0.1
